# Air-flight-price-predicting-model
 Project Overview:
In the dynamic landscape of the airline industry, fluctuating ticket prices pose a challenge for both airlines and passengers. The project addresses this issue by focusing on the crucial problem faced by airline analysts—determining the criteria for predicting ticket prices. With factors such as days remaining before the flight, departure and arrival times, and airline-specific variables influencing prices, the goal is to empower consumers with a tool that can predict trends and recommend optimal flight ticket prices.

Solution Path and Outcome:
The project follows the CRISP-DM framework to develop three machine learning models—Linear Regression, RandomForest Regressor, and Linear Regression with 10-fold Cross Validation. Leveraging an Indian airline dataset, the models are trained to understand the intricate patterns affecting ticket prices. The outcome reveals that the RandomForest Regression model performs exceptionally well, showcasing the lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and a high R-squared value of 0.98. The benefit of this solution is twofold: it equips consumers with insights into optimal ticket prices, enabling informed choices, and it provides airlines with a data-driven approach to pricing, potentially maximizing revenue. The project lays the foundation for a tool that can significantly impact the decision-making process of both passengers and airlines in the realm of ticket pricing.
